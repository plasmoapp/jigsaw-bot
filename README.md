**[jigsaw-bot](./jigsaw-bot)**

- Made with [Teloxide](https://github.com/teloxide/teloxide) Rust framework
- An entry point of the Mini App
- Takes images from users and publishes a [Redis PubSub](https://redis.io/docs/interact/pubsub/) request to [jigsaw-generator](./jigsaw-generator) to generate a puzzle
- Notifies users when a puzzle finished or failed generating
- Allows users to share puzzles with friends using [Inline Query](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#inline-requests)

## Documentation

Most of the code has comments and is aproachable so if you're feeling courageous â€“Â clone the repo and jump straight into it

Here is also a list of specific features you might want to use in your project:

### Mini App authorization on WebSockets (Rust, Axum)

### Custom HTML export template for Godot

### Sync Godot Theme with Telegram Theme 

### Access start

## How to setup a developer enviroment

### 1. Download Docker

Docker Compose will allow us to install dependencies and launch multiple processes with one simple command

Install Docker Engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#desktop

### 2. Setup Ngrok 

You need a secure HTTP connection for a Telegram Web App. To test the app locally you can use ngrok 

Download: https://ngrok.com/download

Then use this command to open a tunnel

```bash
ngrok http 3030
```

Keep the URL that looks like this: `https://<something>-<something>.ngrok-free.app`

### 3. Create a Telegram Bot and a Web App 

Create a bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Don't forget to copy and save the bot token as you will need it later

```
/newbot
```

Enable Inline Mode

```
/setinline
```

Create a Web App. Set URL to the one you got from ngrok. The app can have any name

```
/newapp
```

### 4. Clone the repo 

```
git clone https://github.com/plasmoapp/jigsaw-bot.git
cd jigsaw-bot
```

### 5. Create .env file inside of the cloned repo 

```bash
touch .env
```

```env
# URL of the Web App
CONFIG.WEB_APP_URL=https://<something>-<something>.ngrok-free.app
# Name of the bot. Like in @<bot_name> or t.me/<bot_name>
CONFIG.BOT_NAME=jigsawpuzzlebot
# Name of the Telegram Web App. Like in t.me/<bot_name>/<app_name>
CONFIG.WEB_APP_NAME=game
# Bot Token 
CONFIG.BOT_TOKEN=<bot_token>
```

### 6. Start the containers 

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

```bash
# View status of the containers
docker-compose ps -a

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart a specific container
docker-compose restart backend
docker-compose restart bot
docker-compose restart generator

# Stop everything
docker-compose stop
```

### Keep in mind

[jigsaw-game](./jigsaw-game) project is built inside of the [jigsaw-backend](./jigsaw-backend) Dockerfile

After you've made changed to the [jigsaw-game](./jigsaw-game) project â€“Â you need to restart the `backend` container

App runs on the port `3030` by default. You can change the port inside of the `docker-compose.yaml`
 
## Planned features

I've made some issues of features that I wanted to implement but didn't have time because of the contest deadline

Probably will work on them eventually but I also welcome contributions :)
